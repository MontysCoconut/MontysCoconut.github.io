        The upper right panel contains a code editor for
        <i>Monty</i> code. You may use it to try out some little programs.
        To execute the program, you can type <code>moin</code> into the terminal
        below the editor. Keyboard shortcuts for executing the code are
        <code>CTRL+ENTER</code> or <code>ALT+ENTER</code>.

    <dt>The Terminal:</dt>
    <dd>
        The terminal supports several commands. 
        The command <code>next</code> can be used to go to the next page.
        Similarly the command <code>prev</code> can be used to go one step
        back. To clear the terminal, the command <code>clear</code> can be used.
        <code>moin</code> executes the code inside the editor.
    </dd>

    <dt>Navigation:</dt>
    <dd>
        You can navigate through the challenges by typing commands into the
        terminal, or by clicking the navigation buttons at the top and bottom
        of the left panel. The buttons may be deactivated when a next or
        previous step is not available. In that case you either want to follow
        the instructions on the left panel or return to the list of available
        challenges by clicking on the <span class="fa fa-list"></span> icon in
        the navigation bar.
