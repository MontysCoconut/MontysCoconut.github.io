<h3>Try Monty</h3>
<p>
    <i>Try Monty</i> is a learning platform for the <i>Monty</i> programming
    language, which was developed within a one-year student project at the
    <i>University of Bremen</i>. The project was realized by 14 computer science
    students.
</p>
<p>
    The idea of the learning platform <i>Try Monty</i> was developed by
    <i>Christopher Nottrodt</i> and <i>Carsten Pfeffer</i> and is inspired by
    the interactive <i>Ruby</i> tutorial <a href="http://tryruby.org"
    target="_blank">Try Ruby</a>. The implementation of <i>Try Monty</i> and the
    <a href="https://github.com/cpfr/moin" target="_blank">Moin</a>
    <i>Monty</i> interpreter was done by Carsten Pfeffer.
