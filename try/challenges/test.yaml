                </p>
      code:     |
                // this function is an example how to print values
                def printHelloWorld():
                    print("Hello World!")

                // your implementation should be done here:

                    To be honest, this was just a test of the different level
                    types which are currently implemented. However, we hope that
                    you had a little fun with <em>Monty</em> and this tutorial
                    and we hope to see you back again soon.
